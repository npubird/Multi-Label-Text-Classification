# Deep Learning for Multi-Label Text Classification

This project is my research group project, and it is also a study of TensorFlow, Deep Learning(CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.).

The main objective of the project is to solve the multi-label text classification problem based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Thus, the format of the data label is like [0, 1, 0, ..., 1, 1] according to the characteristics of such problem.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.7
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Data

Research data may attract copyright protection under China law. Thus, there is only code.

实验数据属于实验室与某公司的合作项目，涉及商业机密，在此不予提供，还望谅解。

## Innovation

### Data part
1. Make the data support **Chinese** and English.(Which use `jieba` seems easy)
2. Can use **your own pre-trained word vectors**.(Which use `gensim` seems easy)
3. Add embedding visualization based on the **tensorboard**.

### Model part
1. Deign **two subnetworks** to solve the task --- Text Pairs Similarity Classification.
2. Add a new **Highway Layer**.(Which is useful based on the performance)
3. Add **parent label bind** information to limit the prediction to improve the model.

### Code part
1. Can choose to **train** the model directly or **restore** the model from checkpoint in `train_cnn.py`.  
2. Add `test_cnn.py`, the **model test code**. 
3. Add other useful data preprocess functions in `data_helpers.py`.
4. Use `logging` for helping recording the whole info(including parameters display, model training info, etc.).


## Pre-trained Word Vectors

Use `gensim` package to pre-train my data.
