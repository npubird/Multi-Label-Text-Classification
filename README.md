# Deep Learning for Multi-Label Text Classification

This repository is my research project, and it is also a study of TensorFlow, Deep Learning(Fasttext, CNN, LSTM, RCNN, etc.).

The main objective of the project is to solve the multi-label text classification problem based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Thus, the format of the data label is like [0, 1, 0, ..., 1, 1] according to the characteristics of such problem.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.8 +
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Innovation

### Data part
1. Make the data support **Chinese** and English.(Which use `jieba` seems easy)
2. Can use **your own pre-trained word vectors**.(Which use `gensim` seems easy)
3. Add embedding visualization based on the **tensorboard**.

### Model part
1. Add the correct **L2 loss** calculation operation.
2. Add **gradients clip** operation to prevent gradient explosion.
3. Add **learning rate decay** with exponential decay.
4. Add a new **Highway Layer**.(Which is useful according to the model performance)
5. Add **Batch Normalization Layer**.

### Code part
1. Can choose to **train** the model directly or **restore** the model from checkpoint in `train.py`.
2. Can predict the labels via **threshold** and **topK** in `train.py` and `test.py`.
3. Add `test.py`, the **model test code**, it can show the predict value of each labels of the data in Testset when create the final prediction file.
4. Add other useful data preprocess functions in `data_helpers.py`.
5. Use `logging` for helping recording the whole info(including parameters display, model training info, etc.).
6. Provide the ability to save the best n checkpoints in `checkmate.py`, whereas the `tf.train.Saver` can only save the last n checkpoints.

## Data

See data format in `data` folder which including the data sample files.

### Text Segment

You can use `jieba` package if you are going to deal with the chinese text data.

### Data Format

This repository can be used in other datasets(text classification) by two ways:
1. Modify your datasets into the same format of the sample.
2. Modify the data preprocess code in `data_helpers.py`.

Anyway, it should depends on what your data and task are.

### Pre-trained Word Vectors

You can pre-training your word vectors(based on your corpus) in many ways:
- Use `gensim` package to pre-train data.
- Use `glove` tools to pre-train data.
- Even can use a **fasttext** network to pre-train data.
